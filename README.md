# Backprop Neural Network in R
This is a project I kept from my college days. I took a course called Biologically Inspired Computation, a 400-level CS course but I had very little background in CS.  

However, I was working in the Bioinformatics lab at the time, where I was using R heavily, so I was able to program projects like this. (I can't say I know R anymore ... it's been about a decade since I wrote my last line of R.

See `description.pdf` to read a report that I wrote up on what this neural net was being trained for and the basics of how it works.
